                When a corporate coup occurs and We the People lose control of our government, two things have to happen at once.
                We must abruptly belittle corporations' power and radically enlarge our own. This section introduces the most
                promising means to the latter end. Most of the following ideas have not only been time-tested in such "radical"
                societies as Switzerland, Denmark or suburban Philadelphia, they all have active local movements pushing them
                forward today. If you are constitutionally more comfortable rebuilding sovereign power from the ground up
                (rather than yanking the usurping bastards on top down), choose a tool and lend a hand.

                  The National Initiative For Democracy is a proposed amendment to the US Constitution and an accompanying federal statute,
                  which will bring the People into government as lawmakers at the national level and in every state and local government
                  jurisdiction in the United States. Beginning in 2002, the People will have an opportunity to enact this Initiative
                  in a national election conducted by the nonprofit corporation, Philadelphia II.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Under the National Initiative, the People's lawmaking power will parallel, not replace, the powers of our elected legislators.
                  There will be two sources of law: the People and their elected representatives.

                  and his colleagues. The Democracy Foundation and Philadelphia II, two nonprofit corporations led by Senator Gravel,
                  are now working to bring about the enactment of the National Initiative. In 2002, The Democracy Foundation will launch
                  a public information campaign to educate people about democracy and their sovereign legislative authority derived from
                  First Principles. Philadelphia II will then conduct a nationwide election for the enactment of the National Initiative.

                  Not only do corporations illicitly claim the Constitutional rights of human persons, they aggressively refuse those
                  same rights to their own employees. Today US workers enjoy about the same freedoms in their workplace as indentured
                  serfs in a fascist land. Peter Kellman and the Labor Party have a rather more American idea. They demand a law that
                  would finally eliminate slavery in all its forms. In effect, their law would restore three vital freedoms:

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Up to now, courts have privileged employer property rights over the workers' free speech rights.
                    If workers are to enjoy effective freedom of speech and expression, this must change in at least three ways:
                  </p>
                  <div className="space-y-6 pl-6 border-l-2 border-red-900/20">
                    <p>
                      Workers must enjoy freedom of speech on as well as off the employer's property… When an employer has the power
                      to effectively determine who will — and who will not — speak to "its" workers, the employer is acting as a master
                      and it is putting the workers in the position of dependent slaves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Workers must be free from employer as well as government censorship except where job performance is at stake…
                      When an employer censors a worker's speech for reasons unrelated to job performance, it is acting as a master
                      and putting the worker in the position of a slave.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The people — including workers — must be free to express themselves by withholding patronage and requesting
                      others to withhold patronage… When workers are prohibited from effectively communicating truthful information
                      about employers, then they are treated more like slaves than like citizens.
                    </p>

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Under the NLRA, the government decides what groups of workers may assemble together for collective action and
                    bargaining. If workers are to enjoy effective freedom of association, this must change in at least two ways:
                  </p>
                  <div className="space-y-6 pl-6 border-l-2 border-red-900/20">
                    <p>
                      Any size group of workers can form an association, including a union, and present and resolve grievances and
                      make agreements with the employer… When an individual worker is forced to face the collective power of a
                      corporate employer without the support of his or her union, she is placed in the position of a helpless
                      slave dealing with a powerful master.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Workers, not the government or the employer, must determine the scope of their own associations for purposes
                      of collective action and bargaining… When workers cannot determine who they will associate with for mutual
                      aid and protection, they are denied a basic right of citizenship.

                  <p className="mb-6">
                    Under current law, the workers' freedom of labor is subordinated to employer property rights. For workers to
                    enjoy effective freedom of labor, this must change in at least four ways:

                        The right to strike must include the right not to lose one's job permanently to a strikebreaker...

                      <p>
                        When an employer has the power to punish workers for exercising their fundamental rights, the employer is
                        acting as a master and the employee is a slave whose rights mean nothing.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        …by, for example, supplying them with parts, distributing their products, or financing their operations.
                        When a "neutral" employer can compel a worker to contribute his or her personal labor to assist another
                        employer in violating the human rights of its employees, the employer is placed in the position of a master
                        and the worker in that of a slave with no control over his or her personal labor.

                      <p>
                        When employers can use corporate formalities to render workers' rights meaningless, the employer is acting
                        like a master and the employee is reduced to slavery.

                        because of artificial corporate boundaries, then corporations become arrogant masters while workers are
                        reduced to dependent slavery.
